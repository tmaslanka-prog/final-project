# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

NFL Score Predictor

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A machine learning model that predicts the outcomes of NFL games.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will be able to receive the names of two NFL teams, along with a couple of other pieces of information, and will be able to predict the outcome of the game at a rate of 50% or better. It will be able to process data collected from NFL databases and use this processed data to make the prediction. The data will include from the most simple data to (hopefully) the most advanced analytics the NFL has to offer. I plan to import and organize the data, analyze it, and create a model, run it and evaluate its performance and make necessary changes, and then continue to add parameters and make updates weekly based on the models previous performance. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what I will create a model that can predict the winner of the NFL Games.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be for me to create a model that can predict the winner and the final score of the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be a model that can do both of those listed above at a success rate of 60% or higher.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps will involve me collecting data from libraries that store data from the NFL, handling the data, and continuing to improve upon the model. I will need to learn how to plot data, and learn about the different model choices so I can make a choice on which kind I want to use. I plan on researching what factors and stats most commonly help to indicate the outcome of NFL games, and make the researched factors the main decider in my model. I also plan to come more familiar with methods that will allow me to tune it and make it more accurate week after week.
