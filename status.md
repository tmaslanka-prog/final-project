Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Watched plenty of videos and learned tutorials on machine learning, imported needed libraries, downloaded needed files, and have began to sort through and organize data.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to finish organizing my data and implement a linear regression model based off of imported data. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have had a challenging time understanding machine learning, knowing what kind of model to use, and how to use it. I have also struggled with the tedious work this model entails, as a lot of different data factors into the outcome of NFL games. I originally planned to have my model running by now so I could tweak it, but I underestimated the difficulty of this project.
